            <h1>What is Treaty One?</h1>
            <article>
                <pre>
                    Treaty One was a foundational agreement signed between First Nations and the Canadian Government. 
                The treaty covered the majority of Southern Manitoba, including the areas around Winnipeg. This treaty 
                was created as a way for the Canadian government to secure land for more European settlers while promising 
                certain rights and protections to the Indigenous People who had lived there for generations. The agreement 
                included promises about land, resources, and the protection of First Nations' way of life. However, the treaty 
                has been the subject of many misunderstandings and misinterpretations by both parties.

                    To the First Nations, treaties are a sacred agreement that constitutionalize their relationship with the British Crown. 
                They believed that the agreements would guarantee mutual respect, protection of their lands, and cultural preservation. 
                However, over time, many First Nations leaders argue that the Canadian government has not honored the promises 
                made in these treaties, leading to disputes and calls for renegotiation or recognition of the promised treaty rights.
