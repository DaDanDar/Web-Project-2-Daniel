            <h1>The History And Terms Of Treaty One</h1>
            <pre>
                    Treaty One, also called the "Stone Fort Treaty," was the first of eleven numbered treaties negotiated between 1871 and 1921. 
                It was signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry by the Canadian government and the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree peoples 
                of southern Manitoba. It was signed by government representatives including Lieutenant-Governor Adams G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, 
                and Major A.G. Irvine, with eight witnesses. The Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree signatories included Red Eagle (Mis-koo-ke-new 
                or Henry Prince), Bird Forever (Ka-ke-ka-penais or William Pennefather), Flying Down Bird (Na-sha-ke-penais), Centre of Bird's 
                Tail (Na-na-wa-nanan), Flying Round (Ke-we-tay-ash), Whip-poor-will (Wa-ko-wush), and Yellow Quill (Os-za-we-kwun). From the 
                Canadian government's perspective, the treaties aimed to promote Western settlement and the assimilation of Indigenous peoples into 
                Euro-Canadian society. Indigenous peoples viewed the treaties as a way to protect their land and culture, as they seek support in 
                adapting to new ways of life. Treaty One reflects these conflicting goals, leaving behind unresolved issues due to different 
                interpretations of the agreement by both parties.

            <h1>The Terms Of Treaty One</h1>
            <pre>
                    In the original text of Treaties 1 and 2, no provisions were included for the promised agricultural tools, clothing, and animals. 
                These were called the "Outside Promises" and were not ratified with the main treaty text. Chief Henry Prince and others refused to 
                sign without these promises, and it was agreed they would be written separately. By 1872, complaints about unfulfilled promises reached 
                Lieutenant-Governor Archibald, who blamed Indian Commissioner Simpson and the lack of a local commissioner. Ottawa appointed Joseph Provencher 
                to replace Simpson in 1873. Complaints continued, with some bands refusing annuity payments. Witness Molyneux St. John sent Ottawa a list of 
                Outside Promises, highlighting the need to provide tools for agricultural pursuits. The federal government addressed the issue on April 30, 1875, 
                with them recognizing the Outside Promises as part of the treaties. These included providing animals like bulls, cows, and pigs, and equipment 
                like plows and buggies, along with raising the annuity from three to five dollars per year.
